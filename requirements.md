Background

Local governments often face challenges in promptly identifying, prioritizing, and resolving everyday civic issues like potholes, malfunctioning streetlights, or overflowing trash bins. While citizens may encounter these issues daily, a lack of effective reporting and tracking mechanisms limits municipal responsiveness. A streamlined, mobile-first solution can bridge this gap by empowering community members to submit real-world reports that municipalities can systematically address.

Detailed Description

The system revolves around an easy-to-use mobile interface that allows users to submit reports in real-time. Each report can contain a photo, automatic location tagging, and a short text or voice explanation, providing sufficient context. These submissions populate a centralized dashboard featuring a live, interactive map of the city's reported issues. The system highlights priority areas based on volume of submissions, urgency inferred from user inputs, or other configurable criteria.

On the administrative side, staff access a powerful dashboard where they can view, filter, and categorize incoming reports. Automated routing directs each report to the relevant department such as sanitation or public works based on the issue type and location. System architecture accommodates spikes in reporting, ensuring quick image uploads, responsive performance across devices, and near real-time updates on both mobile and desktop clients.

Expected Solution

The final deliverable should include a mobile platform that supports cross-device functionality and seamless user experience. Citizens must be able to capture issues effortlessly, track the progress of their reports, and receive notifications through each stage — confirmation, acknowledgment, and resolution.
On the back end, a web-based administrative portal should enable municipal staff to filter issues by category, location, or priority, assign tasks, update statuses, and communicate progress. The platform should integrate an automated routing engine that leverages report metadata to correctly allocate tasks to departments.
A scalable, resilient backend must manage high volumes of multimedia content, support concurrent users, and provide APIs for future integrations or extensions. Lastly, the solution should deliver analytics and reporting features that offer insights into reporting trends, departmental response times, and overall system effectiveness — ultimately driving better civic engagement and government accountability.

The Solution I am trying to build

1. Core user stories (MVP → V1)

Citizen: submit issue (photo, GPS, note/voice), see status, get notifications, rate resolution.

Auto-routing: classify by category + geofence → assign department; escalate if SLA breached.

Supervisor/JE: triage queue, reassign, set priority/SLA, dispatch to worker, update progress.

Worker: see tasks on map/list, navigate, update status, add work notes & photos.

Admin: create departments, supervisors, categories, SLAs; see citywide analytics.

2. Tech stack (practical + scalable)

Mobile app: Flutter (Android/iOS), Mapbox/Google Maps SDK, offline queue via hive/isar.

Web portal: React (Vite) + Tailwind (or your preferred stack) with Mapbox GL/Leaflet.

Backend API: Node.js (NestJS or Express), TypeScript, Postgres + PostGIS, Redis (queues + caching), BullMQ for jobs.

Storage: S3/Cloudflare R2 (images/video), signed URLs; optional Cloudinary for on-the-fly thumbnails.

Auth: JWT (short-lived access + refresh), RBAC (roles: Citizen, Worker, Supervisor, DepartmentAdmin, SuperAdmin).

Notifications: FCM (push), email/SMS via SendGrid/Twilio.

Maps/Geo: Mapbox tiles; reverse-geocoding fallback to Google if needed.

Observability: Winston + OpenTelemetry, Prometheus + Grafana dashboards, Sentry errors.

Deployment: Docker, Nginx, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), single-region to start → multi-AZ later.

4. Auto-routing & priority engine

Routing rules (evaluated in order):

If citizen selects category → use categories.defaultDeptId.

Else ML/text rules (keyword map), or image tagger (optional later).

Geo fence: if report point ∈ department.areas polygon → that dept overrides default.

Fallback → Admin triage queue.

Priority score (0–100):

score = w1*severity + w2*proximityToSensitiveZones + w3*trafficImpact + w4*volumeHotspot + w5\*agePenalty

Tunable per city; “hotspot” from kernel density of open reports in a 200–500m radius.

SLA deadline = now + category/dept SLA hours; escalation job runs via BullMQ.

5. Status lifecycle & notifications

submitted → (auto-ack push/SMS)

acknowledged (dept) → assigned (worker gets push + job card)

in_progress (location & photos) → resolved (citizen asked to confirm/rate)

auto_closed after X days if citizen silent; all steps logged in timeline.

Breach alerts: T-2h reminder to supervisor; breach → escalate to DepartmentAdm

SLA breach rate, heatmap buckets, top categories, dept leaderboards.

7. Admin web portal (screens)

Live Map: cluster markers by status, heatmap layer, filter drawer (category, dept, SLA, date).

Queues: “New”, “At Risk (SLA)”, “Unassigned”, “Escalated”.

Case view: left—photos/timeline; right—details, SLA, buttons (Assign/Reassign/Hold/Resolve).

Workforce: worker list with live locations/availability, skill tags, load.

Settings: departments, categories, SLAs, geofences (draw polygons), roles.

Reports: export CSV/PDF, monthly KPIs.

8. Mobile UX (Flutter)

3-tap report: Camera → Auto-locate → Choose category/add note → Submit.

Offline first: queue submissions; background upload when online.

My Reports: timeline chips, map pins, chat-like updates.

Worker mode (role-aware): task list/map, navigate (intent to Google Maps), checklists, before/after photos, status buttons.

9. Performance & scalability

Images: client-side compression; upload to S3 via signed URLs; store only paths in Mongo.

Realtime: WebSockets (Socket.IO) for live dashboard updates & task pushes.

Caching: Redis for hot filters and map tiles meta; CDN for media.

Heavy queries: geospatial + time windows; use lean projections and compound indexes.

Background jobs: image thumbnailing, hotspot recompute, SLA watchers, notification fan-out.

10. Security & governance

RBAC on every route; row-level checks by dept/role.

PII: minimal collection; encrypt at rest (KMS), TLS in transit.

Audit trail in events; immutable, time-synced.

Rate limits + bot protection on public endpoints.

Backups: daily Mongo snapshots; disaster recovery instructions.

11. Analytics/KPIs to ship

Submission trend, category mix, ward/zone heatmap.

Median acknowledge time, median resolve time, SLA breach %.

Dept/ward leaderboard, repeat-issue hotspots, citizen satisfaction (stars).

Cohort of first-time vs repeat reporters.

12. Delivery plan (aggressive but realistic)

Week 1 (MVP): Auth, report submission w/ media & location, auto-routing v1, citizen “My Reports”, admin list + basic map, assign to worker, push notifications.
Week 2: Full status lifecycle, SLA timers + escalations, worker app screens, thumbnails, clustering on map, CSV export.
Week 3: Analytics dashboard v1, department geofences, role management, audit logs, polishing.
Week 4: Load tests, security hardening, app store prep, docs & handover.
